austin's code journal

# 12/06/2023
Today I picked up where I left off & started working on this 30 day Javascript challenge I was told to practice with & it's made a big difference so far.

I familiarized myself with methods like .strokeStyle & .moveTo, utilizing console.table & console.group while also getting to know GitHub itself a little more. I have the most experience with GitLab, so I know how to do solve problems on here but it's new terrain for sure.

After many attempts of failing to push to the proper branch, I stepped back to think & realizded that I forgot to merge my old branch with the new before typing add ., commit -m "your-text-here" & git push origin main into my terminal. So I did & now I got this journal up & running finally!
