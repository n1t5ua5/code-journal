Today I picked up where I left off & started working on this 30 day JavaScript challenge I was told to practice with again & it's made a big difference so far. I familiarized myself with methods like .strokeStyle & .moveTo, grew accustom to using tools like console.table & console.group instead of just console.log while also getting to know how to use GitHub better. I'm more familiar with GitLab, so I know a lot of Git commands already but it's still new terrain.

After many attempts of failing to push to the proper branch, I stepped back to think & realized that I forgot to merge my old branch with the new before inputting add ., commit -m "your-text-here" & git push origin main into my terminal. I also discovered a few other standard commands like git config user.name & user.email. Now all my work is published.

Documentating everything I'm learning like this helping me a lot, I'm really happy I finally started this. After a few more additons I'll make a basic web application for this whole project.

Working again with the JavaScript30 Challenge, always to find that there really is something new to learn everyday. I began making a function called handleCheck which finds if a user has clicked on a checkbox or not. I'm also installing GitHub Co-Pilot today since I am learning all of these commands on my own for the first time, I need some assistance.
