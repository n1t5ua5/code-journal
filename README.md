Austin's Code Journal

Why forget what's learned when you can have it as a permanent resource?

Please check out the entries.py file where I cover everything coded by myself on a regular basis.

I'll periodically update this project as well & eventually it'll become it's own live application to further showcase the importance of open-source technical documentation.
