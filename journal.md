It's always rough starting a new semester but I feel more prepared than usual this time. The most helpful thing is having access to a tutor that can guide me in the right direction when I'm going off-path. The most difficult class so far is my math class & I probably won't do too much journaling about that one. However, the other two I'll have enough to write about even though neither course is based on coding either. I know a little from my own research regarding Network Technologies but there's a lot to digest about Security Essentials. So far I've conducted some written research regarding different network topologies for the first class & threat actors for the second. For the record, I'm posting all of these without any sort of revisions from my professor(s), so it's possible that some of the information in my journals is incorrect, although I try my best to only include things I'm able to fully grasp. Regarding my first few posts from this semester: hacktivisits usually work independently of government organizations while state-sponsored attackers explicitly work on their behalf. That's all for now, folks!
