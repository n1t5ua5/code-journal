N1T5UA'5 CODE JOURNAL

Why forget what's learned when you can have it all as a permanent resource?

Please check out the n1t5ua5.md file where I cover everything coded by myself on a regular basis!

Even though journailing is the main priority for this little project of mine, eventually it'll become it's own live app to further showcase the importance of utilizing open-source technical documentation.
