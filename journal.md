It's always rough starting a new semester but I feel more prepared than usual this time. The most helpful thing is having access to a tutor that can guide me in the right direction when I'm going off-path. The most difficult class so far is my math class & I probably won't do too much journaling about that one mostly due to the fact that we don't have any written assignments. However, the other two will both have written assignment (neither course requires hands on coding). I know a little from my own research regarding Network Technologies but there's a lot for me to digest about Security Essentials. So far I've conducted some written research regarding different network topologies for the first class & submitted another about threat actors for the second. For the record, I'm posting all of these without any sort of revisions from my professor(s), so it's possible that some of the information in my journal sections are incorrect, although I try my best to only include things I'm able to fully grasp. That's all for now, folks!
