Back in the Winter I had started regularly using another app on my phone called Sololearn to practice more hands on coding in my spare time but as my cell phone deteriorated & I got caught up in some other projects I stopped using it. But now that I have a new phone I downloaded it again & reembarked on my 'solojourney'. I generally start from the bottom in any sort of learning course but after a few years of practice, I can confidentally say that I know a lot of this stuff already. In general, I am still very much a junior engineer but in regards to this first crash course from them about general web development, I'm set. Today's lesson was just about identifying different HTML elements like H1, H2 & P. It feels good reinforcing these foundational concepts though! I'm going to have to go through their catalog one more time though to challenge myself a little more

I'm in the midst of moving so I'm not doing a ton of hands on coding these next two weeks but I still managed to reach a new milestone this morning! I hit a 365 day streak using Duolingo + I've used Codecademy for 365 days altogether too. Every day when I wake up I do three things: pet my cat, open my Duolingo app, then Codecademy. It's obvious why my cat comes first, but the other too come next before everything else I need to start my day because it truly helps to wake me up & start learning at the smallest level possible which makes getting the bigger tasks done seem a lot easier. I highly recommend using them to anybody with a busy schedule or wanting to learn more in their spare time.

Pleased to report that the ol' soccer project is properly pulling data from the API for the new season! There will always be some stretch goals worth accomplishing to make the app a little cleaner, but everything is working & I'm happy with that for now. Considering everything worked for this new season, next season when San Diego FC makes their Major League Soccer debut they should automatically appear underneath the Western Conference section so long as the API administrator (UnlimitedAPI) integrates them in time. I will check in on this in about six months from now to ensure the database doesn't pause on us again for inactivity & then re-check in 2025 for SDFC. Other than that, enjoy everybody!!

I had an epiphany that resolves a mental road block I had in my mind about a big project I've been progressively building in my spare time. I couldn't figure out what the blueprint should be for a building design but after looking at the woods in my backyard this afternoon with my cat I finally understand. I know it sounds a little bit weird at first but it's all about bioengineering hemp for food, it's tough to explain because I'm still trying to understand what's happening myself if I'm being completely honest, so I'll just leave it at that for now. I know a lot of these journal entries don't sound like hands on coding experiences each time per se, but getting these ideas that are all about the code I want to write on 'paper' first inside these markdown files really does help me put everything into perspective. So next week is going to be great now that I have a lot of this old stuff figured out already. I submitted & completed my first ticket with Jira regarding this project too which felt great. I love note taking so I think I'm going to love using this to help in that aspect too. I finished almost all of my homework due for school early, now I have time to refocus on those TypeScript & Redux courses on Codecademy this weekend. I checked my WakaTime account for the first time in a while after I updated this journal; I should really pay for the upgraded version because they have the best data about me as a programmer since it picks up everything I'm writing in VS Code; below is a chart from them. Three cheers for getting everything done!

Inter Miami won their game last night 2-0 against Real Salt Lake, it was a good game. I couldn't help but check to see if the MLS project had indeed started working already & it was as of this morning! I'm glad to see that, so I'll assume the rest of the teams will follow suit once they play but it looks like we're off to a good start this season. I called into Pair Networks last night to check back in on one project I was hosting because they stressed the importance of adding recaptcha to a form I made. After properly diagnosing what was happening to them, they realized that somehow, I accidentally began the process of setting up an enterprise recaptcha account instead of just a normal one for individuals. They sent me the correct link & I began the process again of fixing this form once & for all + adding in another new e-mail address instead of using Gmail to communicate with. I'm feeling really good going into the weekend knowing that my portfolio is robust & functioning properly. Time to revisit my CodeCademy course on TypeScript & Redux!

I've been meaning to open a Jira account for awhile now to start working regularly with ticketing systems for my business. Knowing the full benefits of note taking, I know that using this system will help put that knowledge to good use. Technical documentation has grown on me, as it provides insight into not only fixing bugs & troubleshooting in the past & present, but it becomes an index for the future on how to fix unique problems. I like the interface so far, my first ticket is going to be about something new I'm building... Also, the Major League Soccer season starts tonight which means I'll know soon if my 3rd party API is still working inside the MLS Monitor project. I'll call it quits once all teams have played at least one game though just to make sure everything is all good. But even after that I see one more potential fix that might need to take place in the future; the addition of San Diego FC to the Western Conference. The 2025 season calendar is yet to be announced, but I'll need to check in on this again then to make sure it still works.

After finishing my classes at college today I realized that I needed to learn more about another programming language, but which one? I landed on TypeScript. TypeScript is a programming language that I first learned to use back at the software engineering bootcamp I went to. Now it's time to get some more hands-on coding practice with it. I enrolled in a new course via CodeCademy so at least in my spare time I have an easy way to learn more. They start off explaining how JavaScript may not be so useful when building large-scale applications which is why Microsoft released TypeScript to the public in 2012. It expands on the same principles behind JavaScript but now, "it allows us to write JavaScript with a set of tools called a type system that can spot potential bugs in, clarify the structure of, and help refactor our code". The first activity is the classic, Hello World! I run the tsc command in the terminal which created an identical index.js file, then input ls the confirm if that was true or false & it was there. So I ran the resultant of the JavaScript file with the node command node index.js & eureka! Hello World! was output into the console as expected. I'm off to a great start. Now I'm learning about type references.

Checked on all the e-mails in my scheduled folder inside of Weebly. I've been using them as a host for websites for years now because they also offer an effective e-mail marketing tool called Promote. You can't edit the code base much, but you can edit & publish e-mails in a way similar to programs like Mailchimp. This newsletter I'm currently working on is set to go out tomorrow so I figured it couldn't hurt to look them over one last time to spot any errors; in a little over a year from now I'll have finished this particular digital campaign I strategized. It's been nothing short of a success so far: 99 percent delivery rate, 41 percent open rate, 13 percent click rate + all subscribers get a free packet of organic seeds annually. It's mostly a data driven newsletter, where we publish different studies on a variety of subjects like working remotely & bioengineered plants. After, I started where I left off on getting this form to work correctly in a different project that's hosted via Pair Networks, but so far only a few e-mails have managed to arrive in the proper e-mail account's inbox. Maybe this is not the way I should go about this, because the From e-mail is listed as no-reply at your-domain dot com but I never actually registered that name so I think I should register a new e-mail address with Pair. After I'll have to get past a few more steps like creating a new account with Google reCAPTCHA. This is all according to the documentation provided by the host which I linked above.

https://flexboxfroggy.com/

My cousin who is a software engineer showed me this random website called Flex Box Froggy awhile back so I figued I'd check it out again today because I haven't been working too much with CSS lately. It's easy at first but after awhile it gets a little more complex as you go through each level 1 - 24. For the first half of the levels, you're mostly working on using the selectors align-items, justify-content & flex-direction to match frogs onto lilypads that appear to the right of the code editor. One of the levels is described like this, "Sometimes reversing the row or column order of a container is not enough. In these cases, we can apply the order property to individual items. By default, items have a value of 0, but we can use this property to also set it to a positive or negative integer value (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2). Use the order property to reorder the frogs according to their lilypads.". It's a good way to brush up on some commonly used styling components + I love how it's animal-friendly. I got to level 24 which I'll finish in the morning & I forked the GitHub repo too to study it a little more in depth.

Spent the afternoon searching for other colleges to attend because my computer programming track doesn't allow for minors at my college. I didn't realize this until the approaching semester's deadline for registration so I signed up anyways to start, but now it's time to look elsewhere because I need to minor in Spanish. I keep expanding my knowledge everyday by reading physical books in Spanish everyday, practicing with Duolingo, listening to Latin music, watching fútbol at night & talking with my partner everyday over the phone but I need a tutor & a college level course to assist me in growing more. I have a lot of random questions that I need to ask a teacher so yep, onward I go in this search. I know there's something out there that's right for me, I just have to look in the right places. Outside of my personal life, as I've learned more about web development these past three years, I now fully understand the utility of being able to communicate in other languages. This sort of diversity makes life beautiful & allows us to solve unique problems.

Took a break from doing hands-on coding today to re-evaluate all the projects I'll be working on & choose the one of most importance. I'm also continuing the job search so I can make a decent living solving problems. I looked inside Glassdoor dot com for the first time in awhile today, I see a couple of opportunities...

Snowing like crazy today, at least half a foot, so my Valentine's Day plans are sadly cancelled... but at least I have my cat. I bought them a new bed - it's shaped like an old TV except it's hollowed out so they can sleep inside it - I hope they like it haha. My partner was incredibly understanding about the weather too, I love them so much & can't wait to see them soon 💘 After class today I delved back into another old project in a private repository that needed a quick fix. It's built mainly using PHP so I added in the new e-mail address to the form in my submit.php file thinking it would work fine but I never recieved any e-mails after several attempts. I couldn't spot any errors in the console & every form was successfully filled out in the browser due to the error handling I setup previously. Turns out I needed to ensure there were From and Reply-To values set for sending the e-mail itself. It goes something like this: $headers .= "From: noreply@your-domain-here.com" . "\r\n"; $headers .= "Reply-To: $email" . "\r\n";. I'm feeling really proud that I got a lot of these old projects touched up so I can move on from them & completely focus on learning/building new stuff like that chess application I wrote about yesterday + I have my school work, volunteer program with Nucleate Cultivate & a new project I'm working on regarding automating the agricultural process using non-virgin materials. I also went down inside this journal to sort through some of the old entries where the formatting was out of place & fix it. I was quickly reminded of when to properly use tags like < & > inside markup files. In some old entries, I used them to describe some of the code I was working with, but .md files listen for those sort of inputs too because the file is 'alive', so they must be seperated like I previously mentioned or you can use quotes to indicate which elements you're creating. Fun stuff!

Talked with my colleague again about resolving that AttributeError but after going through all of the site processes once more & ensuring that everything still worked, we both concluded that this one will have to remain a mystery for now at least. If you have any more information on this sort of error, AttributeError: module 'bcrypt' has no attribute '__about__', please reach out to me here to discuss! In regards to the original TypeError, it was really frustrating at times but patience is a virtue + now I'm in gear for the upcoming MLS season which starts in two weeks which I would have had to look out for anyways to ensure the API is updating with the new season - as long as it's successful I'll call this project finished. Thanks to some guidance from friends I was reminded of the importance of checking the deployed logs over just the server logs & of how to update variables in GitLab that repesent a MongoDB URI. In my spare time, I want to create a chess board application using Python so after researching ideas quickly, I came across the one I posted above which seems pretty reasonable but I need to do some more looking to make sure it's familiar all while challenging.

After cleaning my maple sap tapping equipment once more, I set them up so they should be good to go on their own for at least two weeks. While I wait for them collect sap that I'll eventually boil down into to maple syrup, I revisited Module One & Two of my hackathon project for Nucleate Cultivate which is a student group working to solve problems regarding the future of cellular agriculture, precision fermentation & alternative proteins. My group's still in the beginning stages of planning but it's looking good so far; I'm excited to share what we're working on as things progress in the coming weeks.

They seem interesting & worth obtaining but I need to finish configuring my schedule for the upcoming season before I commit to working on any more tasks. Later this aftenoon I recorded a video via Loom to help my colleague better understand the AttributeError I can't seem to fix. Now I'm going to finish my computer programming homework & rest before the upcoming week. Oh yeah, I created a new repository for my group with Nucleate Cultivate; I'll update it after we meet again. ☮️

I need to regroup to resolve this AttributeError from the other day. I know I can do it, but for some reason I can't recall the proper sequence of commands for updating my requirements.txt file now because when I rebuild my project in Docker, over 20 dependencies are added to my file. It's possible they're necessary now but I'm certain that one of them like 'passlib', 'bcrypt' or both are the root cause for the problem, per the fastapi logs. After, I met up with my group from Nucleate Cultivate & we discussed some different ways we can work together on this cellular agriculture hackathon we were accepted to participate in, like which plant(s) can be bioengineered to create protein. Lastly I prepared to tap my maple trees by cleaning the equipment & tomorrow I'm going to clean the yard a little more to make the environment the best it could possibly for the plants. On Sunday I'll do the tapping. I'm so excited to do this again & have some sweet maple syrup afterwards!

I met up with a senior engineer & my cousin last night for dinner to learn more about the software engineering company the SWE works for. Overall, their aim is help visualize data for clients by creating graphs using mostly Java & Springboot. I gained a ton of knowledge & discovered some new resources that I'm starting to look into just now. After meeting yet another engineer that uses Java, I'm convinced it's a language I need to invest more of my time learning about. This morning I finished my second week of college & it's still going well although we haven't delved too far into the syllabus for either class I'm taking yet. I'm going to dive back into that AttributeError for the rest of today, finish my homework from school & then prepare to meet up with my partners on my project from Nucleate Cultivate tomorrow. I'm also going to publish a longer journal update regarding that TypeError my colleague helped me resolve yesterday, but I need a little more time to prepare something more concise because I know I'm going to incur something similar again in the future.

I had a massive breakthrough today due to a friend's guidance about an old project of mine. They recalled a new dependency update with MongoDB that I was unaware of, reminded me how I needed to add a new variable via GitLab so that this new URI was read right. I updated my .yml file to match the new variable name & finally added/committed/pushed to GitLab. When I went to my logs using glv-cloud-cli logs -a fastapi I recieved a new error; an AttributeError instead of a long conviluted one like I was getting with the TypeError. I'm investigating that some more now, but while I ponder I tested to see if I could login into the deployed project using our bogus passwword & eureka!!!!! I'm so happy this was diagnosed properly & I can move forward. I'll have to keep an eye on any updates from MongoDB & FastAPI, but now I know how to handle updates like that in general which will definitely come in handy in the future. Incredibly grateful for my friends & their willingness to work with me - working together really does work.

As I've written about previously, my friend who's been working as a software engineer for many years lent me a second programming book 'cuz they're a stellar person. Since learning about how other books' have repos here on GitHub, I looked up one about my new book & thankfully they have one too except it was more robust then most. This repo included many different versions for specific programming languages, so I forked one on Python for when I'm ready to review some of the solutions. My Microcomputer Applications class today went well, it's early in the morning but a lot more fundamental than I imagined so, so far it hasn't been to difficult. Tomorrow I'll meet with a colleague to fix a TypeError from an old project, so I'm mentally preparing for how to resolve it in my head 'til then.

Recharged my batteries over the weekend along with continuing the conversation on Discord with a colleague about a persistent TypeError. While waiting to hear back from them, I finished all my computer programming homework for college which I'm really, really proud of. I've been wanting to do this for so long & it feels good that it's finally happening. I know Sage is proud & that Savi is too. On Wednesday I'm meeting up with my cousin & his software engineering buddy for dinner, so I'm reviewing a data structure problem that another friend of mine quizzed me on before & brushing up on Big O notation by talking about its relevance to both code & business out loud to myself. Being able to verbalize these concepts really helps me solidify my knowledge of them.

I finished my first week of college today! It was mostly just a process of getting setup for the semester so it wasn't too difficult but it happened nonetheless. Afterwards I re-started the debugging process for that ol' soccer project of mine by talking with a colleague about the TypeError I keep encountering & he reminded me of the importance of checking which version my atlas cluster was using. I logged back into MongoDB & low & behold, the first thing in the dashboard shows how the project was paused due to inactivity. So I clicked resume, waited for it to reboot, selected a few options to re-sinstall the proper drivers & then I rebuilt my own project using docker-compose up --build in my terminal to see the results.


# Wednesday, 01/31/2024

Picking up where I left off from yesterday, which is pretty much back to where I started from the previous today because I ran into a new TypeError. After looking over my project with me, my friend told me that it looks like a dependency was randomly updated without notifying me, so I tried adding a new one that would handle the 'passlib' library, per the error in my fastapi logs in the terminal. After adding/commiting/pushing etc. my pipelines failed in GitLab, so I inspected the new error in there & realized I had gotten rid of an extra dependency instead of just adding in the new one so then I added 'jwtdown-fastapi' back inside my requirements.txt file once more & now the original 500 response persists, but my pipelines are at least passing again which is a big relief.


# Tuesday, 01/30/2024

My first class of college level computer science went really well; my professor seems like a really nice person! We mainly just reviewed the class syllablus, opened our textbooks for the first time & other basic stuff like how to use this program called Canvas which contains all the info we need for each module. I have another intro class I have to take in a little so I'm gunna rest until then & when I'm finished I'll revisit fixing that pesky 500 response from yesterday.


# Monday, 01/29/2024

As I prepare for my first Microcomputer Applications course tomorrow morning, I want to finish this ol' soccer project. After I've cd'd into the proper directory, I input the command docker-compose up --build into my terminal, I waited about five minutes for the webpack to compile successfully & then input glv-cloud-cli logs -a fastapi to view the logs tp locate a more specific reason as to why this 500 error I've incurred keeps persisting but no new advances were made.


# Thursday, 01/25/2024

My friend lent me another book on coding which was highly appreciated not just due to the thought but because I really need to buckle down & learn about more data structures. The book's called "Cracking the Coding Interview: 189 Programming Questions & Solutions" written by Gayle Laakman McDowell. From what I'm told, most of the questions are aqnostic to which language it can be used with but Java & C++ are frequently used; I've been looking for an excuse to learn more about those two specifically so I'm happy I finally have a good reason now. On a separate note, I was also reminded by my friend of the importance of utilizing a deployed projects logs to debug errors instead of the local logs. This gave me a fresh perspective on solving a unique problem I'm facing regarding a random 500 response inside a project of mine which I'll tackle this upcoming Monday.

I found another useeful repo on here called Free Programming Books which sheds light on some other material I'll have to understand as time goes on like expanding my knowledge of data structures in my spare time. I'm grateful for an abundance of resources on coding.

Been working on resolving this 500 response for more than a couple of days now & I still can't figure out what's going wrong. I'm getting a 200 response in the browser for my localhost version, but the deployed one is all jammed up. I talked with some friends about it & they're going to look at it some more while I delve into it again because the only solveable error I see is this one. Here's what I know for sure: I was getting a 200 response about a month prior & I never touched it again until this past week & a half but I never edited the code during this period, nor did my team. Nothing unusual is being returned in the fastapi logs inside of Docker & the project as a whole is functioning fine with the exception of this one crucial component.

While doing some independent reading today I got a ton of inspiration for building useful software for the Hackathon I got accepted to participate in by Nucleate Cultivate. It's about how a company uses precision fermentation to form proteins out of microbes found in the air such as carbon dioxide. The absurd fact that this is even happening to begin with coupled with how it's being used in a food that's not commonly looked to for protein is an ingenious example of innovaton. I've heard of a similar process a few years ago, but it was about utilizing molecules in the air to create water, due to its abundant source of hydrogen. These are the exact sort of solutions we need in order to project ourselves into the best future possible. The Hackathon's provided some more reading for my team & so I'm just focusing on that for the rest of tonight - buenos noches. 


# Friday, 01/19/2024

Eagerly awaiting my first college course on Computer Science! It's called Microcomputer Applications & it starts on the 30th, I can't wait to delve into some foundational stuff. I feel really confident in my basics going forward so though I'm ready for a challenge, I think this first class is going to be pretty easy overall. We'll be covering hardware & software, so I now I really have zero excuses left to buy a Raspberry Pi set to tinker with in my spare time. Haven't done any literal coding in the past two days 'cuz I've been stuck in college-mode, but I met up with fellow SWE's on Thursday which was awesome. We're gunna start collaborating on a pet-adoption app which I feel very passionately about for so many reasons but mostly because non-human animals deserve so much more than what they're given here on Earth. Other than that I kept up my codecademy practice streak + I'm slowly unpacking that Redux eBook at the end of each day.


# Wednesday, 01/17/2024

Started off by getting refamiliarized myself with phpMyAdmin from an old demo of mine. I wanted to make sure I could still download SQL statements of each pseudo-payment made to the database, in case anyone needed a receipt of payment. I found the right info after carefully looking inside some old php files & now I'm good to go. Earlier I had resolved some issue I was recieving in the console of my browser due to this message: "A form field element should have an id or name attribute. A form field element has neither an id nor a name attribute. This might prevent the browser from correctly autofilling the form.
To fix this issue, add a unique id or name attribute to a form field. This is not strictly needed, but still recommended even if you have an autocomplete attribute on the same element."

The console pointed directly towards an input element on line 40 of the Home.jsx file which made fixing the error relatively straightforward. I added a custom if of id="teamSearch" & the error ceased from persisting. I then scanned the rest of the app & now I'm seeing something similar about the form on the Login page, "A form field has an id or name attribute that the browser's autofill recognizes. However, it doesn't have an autocomplete attribute assigned. This might prevent the browser from correctly autofilling the form. To fix this issue, provide an autocomplete attribute."

Id is a property I'm used to using but autoComplete is a little more raw albeit I've used it before inside of forms. After doing some research online & looking over my code, I input a value of password, but then I got another error about this being a "non-standard practice" so I had to search some more & eventually found out that if I set the value to current-password, it should work. I tried it out & bam. Tomorrow I need to resolve a 500 error I'm getting within FastAPI.

Spent today reading, practicing with flash cards on Codecademy & changing the domain mapping for a few of my projects so they all work with the right URL's in the browser + they include an SSL certificate included via Let's Encrypt. Ready for tomorrow, where I'll dive into learning more about mass-producing food from Nucleate Cultivate! Their hackathon that I was accepted to participate in just started & I have about two weeks to finish this foundational section. I wonder what we'll build... I'm hoping my group will be interested in building something that allows people to bioengineer medicine & food directly at home.


# Friday, 01/12/2024

I spent the morning doing some debugging of my own code in a private repo. I kept incurring an error in the console of my browser that stated how the "Number of translated a elements does not match. applyTranslations @ main.js:66 toggleTranslation @ main.js:34 onclick @ (index):81. From that I could tell that the source of the problem originated with my applyTranslate function & how it accepted a elements. It was accepting a elements from the entire program (there are eleven pairs in total), except I only needed the a elements within the nav element that had a class of "green-button" to be translated because the program names generally don't change from english to spanish, just how they're pronounced, so I only wanted the text in the translateButton to toggle along with the h1 & h4 elements to change. I altered the right variables inside of main.js to reflect their proper order & then altered the applyTranslate function so it only accepted those specific a elements. It took awhile to reconfigure it correctly + I had to alter the toggleTranslation function & the onClick event in a similar fashion.

On top of that, I re-familiarized myself with domain mapping when I purchased a new domain to be used for a basic tic-tac-toe project I built. In this case, with Pair as the host which runs on an Apache server, I had to edit the Apache VirtualHost configuration file to associate my new domain with the directory that my project is hosted in. This involved specifying the DocumentRoot & ServerName for the domain within the VirtualHost block. Now that I'm done with this other vanilla JavaScript coding challenge I had been working on, I needed to find something else to practice with in my spare time. I searched for a new eBook (which despite the annoying name are worth the effort) on Redux & found something called "Functional Architecture wwith React & Redux" by Christian Salcescu. It seems pretty legit so far: https://github.com/n1t5ua5/functional-architecture-with-react-and-redux. I also found a tiny course about the basics of Redux on Codecademy to brush up on state management which I've found to be of great value.

I got it to work in the console first by declaring a global variable of let dountdown & then writing a function named timer that expects a parameter of seconds & another beneath it named displayTimeLeft which also expects a parameter of seconds. I utilized the Date.now() method to get the current time in milliseconds. It then calculates the end time of the countdown by adding the input seconds to the current time. Then displayTimeLeft runs to initially show the time left. It logs the remaining seconds to the console & bam. timer(10) works in the console & stops at 1, next I input timer(100) & it returned 100 numbers in the console.

Now the code now interacts with HTML elements using DOM manipulation, document.querySelector, allowing for dynamic updates to the displayed time & end time. The addition of the displayEndTime function formats the end time for a more user-friendly presentation, while the startTimer function responds to button clicks, initiating the countdown with the specified duration. Moreover, the displayTimeLeft function has been improved to set the document title dynamically, enabling users to track the countdown even when the tab is inactive. I am definitely going to use this in a new project I'm going to start working on regarding music. Next I'm going to finish the last challenge once & for all! This one's about making an interactive game.

The HTML file contains mole holes with the class 'hole', a scoring display with the class 'score' & moles with the class 'mole'. Inside the <script></script? tags I declared the variables holes, scoreBoard, moles, lastHole, timeUp & score. Then I defined functions for generating a random time interval (randomTime), selecting a random mole hole (randomHole), making a mole appear & disappear (peep), starting the game (startGame) & handling clicks on moles (bonk). In the startGame function, the score is set to zero & the peep function is called to make a mole appear. The game runs for 10 seconds (setTimeout(() => timeUp = true, 10000)), during which players can click on moles to increase their score. The bonk function increments the score upon a legitimate click & updates the score display. Overall, the code creates a responsive & interactive whack-a-mole game with a 10-second time limit, where players aim to click as many moles as possible to score points.

This project is really useful & reinforces tactics like DOM manipulation & event handling - I'm going to remodel this into one that's called something like 'Whack-A-Cactus' & make it a little more in depth. I'm really proud to go through this whole crash-course. My coding reflexes are a lot more keen then they used to be. From here I'm going to start a course on redux, re-make this game into something better & keep on reading my Python book & download an e-book on JavaScript!

Later today I'll create another private repo for a tic-tac-toe game I made awhile back because I wanted to center it on all devices instead of residing on the left side like it currently does. It'll include to a second one I made as well! I also went back to that php project to fix some naming conventions one more time, I think I can finally put it to rest now. Update: the private repo has been created & I applied the d-n-r style.

I've got two days left of this vanilla JavaScript challenge my friend sent to me, my reflexes are a lot more keen now. Today I'm working on a video speed controller. The .mp4 wasn't working so I'll post a message in Slack if it isn't working by tomorrow. I tried using different browsers & inputting different .mp4 files but that didn't seem to do it either.

I followed along firdt by adding a new addEventListerner which waited for the object of mousemouve. This should show an event in the console but the only thing I get is an error about that ol' .mp4 (I tried simply adding an s to http but I still recieved an error in the console). The code's ready now for double checking tomorrow, considering there were also no notes about this error in the GitHub notes.

Tinkered with an old project that uses php earlier today. I didn't mess around with the logic too much, I mostly altered some naming conventions & that added the files to a new private repo I made for it. Now I'm heading back to finish some more of that vanilla JavaScript challenge I've been working on. Scrolling was the theme of today's lesson. I used the offsetLeft method once more to by subtracting slider.offsetLeft from e.pageX. This calculates the horizontal distance between the mouse click & the left edge of the .items element. Three more days left! Then I'll start a new course on Redux.

Fixed some icon resolution in my portfolio again 'cuz it just wasn't good enough. Now I'm working on a little mini-project about styling navs. After adding writing some addEventListeners & functions (handleEnter & handleLeave), the coordinates on the page are being consoled correctly because the console.log(dropdownCoords) statement inside the handleEnter function is successfully logging the coordinates of the dropdown menu to the console when the mouse enters the navigation element.

After I updated the width & height of the background element based on the dimensions of the dropdown menu (coords) & then the background element finally became responsive to the size of each specific dropdown menu when hovered over. A few more changes & now the code now accurately calculates the dropdown menu's position relative to the .top element & adjusts the background size & position accordingly. 


# Sunday, 01/07/2024

Couldn't help but pick up the portfolio project one more time because the resolution on the mobile versions backdrop wasn't clear enough. Finally found one that works for it well. Thought about going back to that vanilla JavaScript course again but I think it's better to let the batteries recharge some more. 


# Saturday, 01/06/2024

I've been getting carried away with my making my little portfolio site more responsive & now it really is. I had done almost everything planned for it before, but it was still kind of staticky. It's pretty late now so I'm gunna go back to reading tonight & solve some puzzles on Codecademy again.


# Friday, 01/05/2024

I started another private repo, this time for all the random logical problems I find from places like Leetcode & such. It'll be good to have it as a reference to go back to & upload all the past one's into one spot. I want to create a new Leetcode problem, it'll be about human verification. Working with addEventListenders today. I was just introduced to the capture object which according to Wes is a boolean value that specifies whether an event should be handled during the event capturing phase (true) or during the event bubbling phase (false). 

Now we are using the stopPropagation method to stop triggering events from happening. Next the once property will be set to true underneath the capture property to unbind itself from the event. He explains that this sort of function could be used in store checkouts online where you do not want someone to be able to click something more then once. This was a mouthfull but definitely insightful.

Later on in the day I implemented a day / night mode toggle button on my portfolio along with some other minor styling updates. I went back to Codecademy & practiced some more random JavaScript & Python questions + I finally made my own 'Leetcode'-like logicical question too! It's very simple, but I'm feally proud of it. I've signed up for a Kindle account so I can read on the go & now as I'm winding down I finally picked back up the hardcover copy of "Practices of the Python Pro" by Dane Hillard that my friend lent me. I'm feeling increasingly accomplished tonight.

I spent a long time today fixing up my portfolio. I took the vanilla JS & stored it in a main.js file to save some space, fixed up some styling too. Now I finally feel confident sharing it with others. It's hosted on Pair already, but now it's on GitHub too.

Back at the JavaScript30 challenge, today is all about keeping the position of the nav in place. I feel like I've been going into the weeds a little too much on some of my previous entries. So today, I'll focus mostly on the topic of something I learned new today as opposed to going thru every line of code. Using the transform property to maintain an elements initial demensions proved to be super useful; I already know a project that could use something like this.

I created a small game using python to help study for anything I want to learn more about. After being properly forked &
cloned, users can input their own unique datasets & then play the game when running 'python main.py' inside their own
terminal. Questions & answers are formatted in classic A, B, C, D multiple choice style.

Later on this week I'll write more in detail about it, but for now I'm redesigning my portfolio that I built using jQuery. I wrote a function using vanilla JavaScript to make all h4 elements flash on & off to make the application a little more dynamic. Finished the day by practicing some more Python & JavaScript via Codecademy trivia.


# 12/28/2023

Reset my mind over the past week. Taking time to pause from thinking critically in this setting is necessary at times in my
humble opinion. I still want to write some code before the new year starts there to maintain consistency throughout 2024.
The SpeechSynthesis API exists in most browsers, like the SpeechRecognition API I just worked with the other week.

The foundational code in the index-START.html file creates a web interface called "The Voiceinator 5000" where users can
select voices, adjust speech rate & pitch, input text & trigger speech synthesis using JavaScript's SpeechSynthesisUtterance
object, while handling user interactions through event listeners. Some basic styling is included in the style.css file.

On line 39 I set msg.text equal to a querySelector where the name is equal to text & then I called the value afterwards.
I wrote the msg variable into the console & it's returning the SpeechSynthesisUtterance variable. I can tell it's working
because inside the variable is the pre-written text value of "Hello! I love JavaScript ❤️".

I then learned that SpeechSynthesis is another global variable in the console which when calling .speak, allows you to
pass it an utterance. I tried making it work just now with the msg variable, but it's returning undefined because the
program still can't officially detect any speech just yet.

Next I wrote an EventListener for the speechSynthesis global variable which called the 'voiceschanged element' & the 
populateVoices function which is being written above it. The voices variable inside it is set equal this.getVoices(), &
finally I logged the voices variable to the console to check what would be returned.

Each voice is now being displayed in the console upon the page loading, inside of the SpeechSynthesisVoice object. These are
the contents inside 9 - default: false, lang: "fr-FR", localService: false, name: "Google français", voiceURI: "Google français".

Now I am going to loop over the all of the voices & set them as options in the Select a Voice dropdown menu. I used the .map
& .join methods once more to display the options when called via the voice function which includes the .name & .lang attributes.
I also changed the voiceOptions variable to now use the .innerHTML method on a variable named voicesDropdown set equal to voices.

It's working so far! I can see a new dropdown menu with each voice & when I pass the utterance into the console now, a voice is
returning the default text that I wrote above with the emoji. I also tried changing the value of msg via the console & the audio is
being played now too. I love this feeling. Now it's time to get the options to actually work once selected.

I wrote a new function named setVoice & console.logged this.value which corresponds to a new EventListener for the voicesDropdown
variable. It calls 'change' & the setVoice function. Next we set msg.voice is equal to voices.find which loops over the list to find
the correct voice attribute that responds to the option being selected. 

But nothing is working in the console. When I input speechSynthesis.speak(msg), I hear the old the original voice of 'David',
however once I select another name & input the same command into the console, nothing changes. I feel ike everything should
work just fine... what could it be? Instead of panicking, I paused & rewinded the tutorial. 

It looked like everything I was supposed to do checked out & there weren't any errors in the console either...
I scanned my code like a hawk to see if something else had transpired & low & behold I had a syntax issue. Instead of 
checking if voice.name matched this.value, I had written this.valaue. That was easy & now it's all working as it should.

A function named toggle is written now to switch between each voice selected. I call speechSynthesis.cancel() to stop it from
speaking & then speechSynthesis.speak(msg) to start it all over again. toggle() is now being called within the setVoice function
on the next line & now everything is working when it's toggled between the different options just like it should.

A new event listener is added next so that forEach of the 'options' selected, we wait for the setOption function to be
called. After the toggle function the setOption is created & accepts msg[this.value] set equal to this.value which is
whatever the value selected currently is. The pitch & rate knobs are working properly now too & it's weird, lol.

In succession are the buttons that need to be listened to. So I add a fourth one beneath the other three which
listens for the speakButton which simply toggles when clicked. The stopButton however looks for toggle(false) to
be called within a fat arrow function. Lastly I will add the .filter method inside of the populateVoices function.


# 12/21/2023

Speech recogniton is going to be the focal point for today's mini-project. Apparently there's a built-in method with Firefox &
Chrome window.SpeechRecognition || webkitSpeechRecognition (as of the date of the video which is around five years old). First,
I'm figuring out how to at least get the tool to recognize someone talking by creating a new instance of SpeechRecognition();.
Then we set the recognition of interimResults equal to the boolean value of true. So as we speak, the recognition works alongside
us. As instructed, I utilized Node.js once more by inputting "npm install" followed by "npm start" into my terminal to build
a custom server for this project. At this point using these commands feel like muscle memory which definitely makes me happy!

Caught another error as I implemented the recognition to begin each time the page was loaded through recognition.start();
When I loaded the page, nothing changed. So I went into the console & read an error message that said "Uncaught ReferenceError:
recognition is not defined at index-START.html: 20:3. When I see these I can almost immediately recognize there was a typo, as I
had intentionally defined recognition on line 16 - it was the second line I wrote. I used CTRL+F to scan every instance of the
value "recognition" & oddly enough the one on line 16 wasn't appearing in the list. I carefully observed every variable with
said value until I realized I didn't add a second 'i' in the word recognition. Problem solved.

I used addEventListener on the recognition object so that when 'result' is triggered, the speech recogniton commences. Then I
converted the e.results array into a normal JS array using Array.from, after I map over the array using the .map method again
like from yesterday's project. Now my speech is being recognized in the console! This is pretty cool, but it only works when
you keep talking. If you pause, it stops working too because we are always listening for the 'result' & when that finishes,
nothing else is supposed to happen as of now. Gotta fix that by adding in another addEventListener + get it working in the
browser too. Text is showing in the DOM, but I need to get it so that it keeps a record of what's said instead of starting
over each time. I wrote an if statement that checks if the 'results' are final, then the <p> element is appended o the .words
container in the DOM, ensuring that each finalized segment of recognized speech appeared distinctly.

I wanted to practice with a second mini project again today, but apparently the next one on geolocation only works for apple
devices & I only use Windows as of now so I'll just skip to the next one about links. As I get closer to finishing this vanilla
JavaScript course, I'm starting to look for something new to practice with. Ok, time to learn some more. This time we're
replacting something built on Stripe's homepage. Essentially what is happening is that when you hover over different tabs
in the navbar, the links reveal a dropdown menu but instead of the normal one you're used to, the menu expands & has
unique content. We won't replicate the whole thing today, but start with something small. I used const to declare a
variable named "triggers" set equal document.querySelectorAll('a') which selects any <a> element in the DOM & returns
a NodeList that match the previous. Then I created a 'span' element with the class of 'highlight' which attaches
a message into the consolee of "Highlight!!" when the mouse hovers of any <a> element. It's working so far!!

I've been introduced to a new method named .getBoundingClientRect which if used properly will return the exact location where
an element is on the DOM. Now we apply styling to the highlightLink function so that whenever an element is hovered over,
not only do we have an exact location of the element, but this time CSS is applied each time. In our case, a highlighter
is used. It appears to be working at first glance, but when scrolling down & hovering over some more links, the exact
location is not being applied correctly. So in order to make everything match perfectly for this particular application
we will make our own unique coordinates. This was accomplished by adjusting the top & left values to account for the scroll
position of the webpage. Awesome. Tomorrow I'll do some more + I'm finally going to dive back into recreating an
algorithm a friend showed me recently. It can be found on Leetcode too: leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/

Trying to tally strings with the .reduce method this morning. There is a list of video's time-length as strings & I am going to
find the total length of all videos as a number. I've used .reduce before too, so it'll be good to utilize it again & learn
something new in the process. First I declared a variabled named timeNodes & set it equal to Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(
'[data-time]')); which selects all the DOM elements that have a data-time attribute. Then I declared a new variable 'seconds'
to retrieve the seconds for each time listed by using the .map & .reduce function to extract all of the data-time values & store
the data in a new array containing the values. I revisited using the % operator to return whatever is left over from the seconds
variable to determine how many seconds are left from the original 'ul' elements with a class of "videos". Everything works, then
I calculated the total number of minutes by declaring a variable named mins & setting it equal to Math.floor(secondsLeft / 60);
which is basically the same thing I did for the secondsLeft variable. Math.floor rounds down to the nearest whole number.

Now I'm going to work on a different project that's about utilizing webcams through code. To begin, we're using Node.js to input
npm install & then npm start into the terminal. There is a really powerful dependency used inside of our package.json file so
this project can be used on my local machine: "browser-sync": "^2.12.5 <2.23.2". Essentially, you cannot use webcams interchangeably
over the internet for obvious privacy concerns so it must be tied to a secure origin. Localhost is still considere a secure origin
even if the padlock / belt symbol is present like normal sites with https. So this dependency is installed to take a photo through
the webcam. Now that it's installed, both localhost:3000 & localhost:3001 are utilized so not only can it be used on a local machine,
but potentially through a mobile device too. Then inside of my srcipt.js file I wrote a function named getVideo. Inside of the function
is a new (for me), built-in method named navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia which gets the video inside of the video element & then video
is set to true & audio to false. This returns a promise so we use the built-in method of .then & pass a callback function to retrieve
localMediaStream. Finally the getVideo() function is called again in order for this to load. It's working in the console now.

But then I followed Wes' video some more & the webcam light was on but I was not appearing in the upper right hand corner
as it should have worked inititally. He said to declare the video.srcObject equal to window.URL.createObjectURL(localMediaStream);
but in the console an error persisted: scripts.js:8 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getUserMedia')
at getVideo (scripts.js: 8:28) at scripts.js: 19:1. I knew it was calling for an error in regards to getUserMedia, which made sense
because the media in literal terms wasn't appearing & sequentially it probably had to do with line 11 given the logic being
performed: video.srcObject = window.URL.createObjectURL(localMediaStream);. I also knew I had previously clicked allow when
asked for permission by the browser so my setting were correct. I looked inside the files some more & realized Wes left
a comment in the scripts-finished.js file after all.
 
The takePhoto function I wrote is working; I downloaded the image & then opened it to view. I'm happy, this is getting
complex but could definitely be used in the future for some sort of project, this really has become a great resource. 
I used the debugger method to naviagte through each action being taken, in order not to log millions of pixels to the
console via the setInterval function. All the filters are working now, phew, that was a lot.

Introduced to the .replace method today when making a function called sortedBands which should display a list of bands in array
named bands. Implement logic to match prefixes of "a", "the" or "an" at the beginning of every name: return bandName.replace(
/^(a |the |an )/i, '').trim(); The | operator tests if the input is present or not. Then the .sort method is used to see which
order the names should be displayed in. Then the bands are displayed using DOM manipulation & finally the .map & .join method
are used to create a new array which each band name wrapped in an 'li' tag & then brought together into a sigle string. I've
used the .sort & .join method before, but .replace definitely earned it's place in my toolbox.

It's been good being able to learn a little more in my spare time before the year's over. Building & viewing a variety of projects
has taught me a lot of random things that I probably wouldn'tve picked up on by myself. I used this to help fine-tune another
project I've been working on that didn't even necessarily have to do with the lesson I was learning (it was about adding an
addEventListener to detect when a user is scrolling *12/11/23*). But it made me realize the importance of UX when scrolling
down/up & so I redesigned the project's homepage. Now I'm working on this mini-project back in JS30 where I'll be working mostly
on adjusting CSS in an HTML file to work properly. I'm trying to add 'shadow' to an image by writing an addEventLister to detect
when someone moves their mouse over the image. I used DOM manipulation to fetch an element with the class of 'hero' & then find the first
h1 element within the '.here' element like this: const hero = document.querySelector('.hero'); const text = hero.querySelector('h1');.
Then I created a function named shadow & added an addEventListener to check for an element of 'mousemove' which shows where
the user's mouse is. I used the offsetWidth/Height method to show exactly where the mouse is on the page & now wherever I hover,
a specific number is returned in the console. I'm feeling a lot more confident in debugging small issues then I did before too. In the
past when an error appeared in the console, I got a small wave of panic, but now I just feel reassured everytime it points out
any error because it's almost always a syntax issue. The shadow function now shows some color when hovering over it because I added
text.style.textShadow. After applying some more styling & math, the cursor is responding perfectly! That's all for today folks.


# 12/13/2023

First time utilizing the localStorage method & it's pretty straight forward, it saves what you do onto your local machine. I got
refamiliarized with the JSON.stringify method which is a little more specific then the .toString() method which has more of a general
purpose use to display something quickly whereas JSON serilizes the data completely. I also used JSON.parse() again which I've used
many times already. It converts whatever it's calling back into it's original state. So here's what's happening with this little menu
ordering app: when we add an item we put it in localStorage & then when once the page loads, we check if something is in localStorage
or use an empty array as a placeholder. Near the end, event delegation takes place with the toggleDown function by listening for
something higher that's called & then inside of it we check for the item we actually want. Essentially everytime a change is made,
the same action will be performed inside localStorage & then re-write the list. This one was a little more in depth & I really need
to look it over again but for now, that's all for today. Please check the repo for yourself to look over my code & give any feedback!

Practice began today by doing something easy with arrays. I started by declraring variables set equal to an array with a list of names as
strings. Then adding more names to the original array & comparing it with a second variable that was set equal to the previous variable.
...here's what it looked like below..
const players = ['Savi', 'Sage', 'Snickers']
// declared a variable named players equal to an array of names as strings
const team = players;
// declared second variable equal to first variable
console.log(players, team);
// printed both variables in console
team[3] = 'Sadie';
// added a new name to team array
...this is what i printed to the console when i input the team & players variables...
(4) ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']
(4) ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']
team
(4) ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Sage']
players
(4) ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Sage']
...utilized the .concat method to make a copy of the old array & then with an es6 spread operator... (no pun intended)
const team4 = [...players];
// declared variable equal to an array of a copy of players
team4[3] = 'lee-paw';
// added a new name to team array
console.log(team4);
// printed team4 array to console
const team5 = Array.from(players);
// declare new variable named team5 set equal to the Array.from() method which is calling the players variable
...this is what i printed to the console when i input the team & players variables...
team5
(4) ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']
team5[3] = 'cool'
'cool'
players
(4) ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']
team5
(4) ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'cool']
The differences between references & copies seem subtle at first but after practicing in the console with making them too I now realize
their differences in literal terms too. I will write out the code I used once more below...
const person = {
name: 'Sage S',
age: 80
};
const captain = person;
captain.number = 99;
I'm running out of time to write out the code but for the next few steps I learned to copy / reference objects, but I will talk about what
I wrote on line 99 real quick: const sage = Object.assign({}, savi);  The Object.assign() method is used to copy the properties from
the savi object to a new object which in this case is a blank one with nothing in it by default. I'm also going to reverse the
direction I'm writing this journal in. Instead of progressively moving down, I'm going up now. Check out the repo for all my code above.

After practicing some questions on Codecademy about JavaScript & Python I began working on the JS30 project again, today's challenge is
called Slide In on Scroll. I learned about another way to use DevTools, this time with console.count() for printing how many times
something has appeared in the console, this time it was with a new function I wrote called checkSlide that ran everytime a user
scrolled up or down on the .html page. I finished the challenge & was definitely confused at times but it makes sense with some
hindsight. The function checkSlide iterates over each image selected & performs the same operation. Then it calculates the right pixel
value for when the slide comes in with some other checks like if the user has scrolled past the image or not. If those conditions
are met then a CSS class 'active' is added to the image. Phew, that's a mouthful. I'm calling it quits for today. Visit this url to
check out any of the commits I made above.

Worked on a tiny little project that detects which keys have pressed on the keyboard or not. I wrote an if statement that checked if said event happened, which
looked for a variable I declared named secretCode. If the secretCode value appeared in the console after being written in the browser then a built in
JavaScript function named cornify_add() was called. This built in function is a random thing built by developers that makes raindows & unicorns
stuff like that appear in the browser when it it's called, lol. In my spare time I used a CMS program called Square to develop a demo site
for a project I'm working. The domain was purchased, it's now hosted by Square & it's live. It needs more content though so I will
work on that starting tomorrow while I continue to push through this 30 day coding challenge. Find my most recent commit above.

I got a late start today but squeezed in some code nonetheless which made me happy because the momentum is definitely building & I'm feeling more comfortable
writing my own functions & using different methods. As I continue along this JavaScript course, I'm noticing the continued important role that .addEventListener
plays in using vanilla JavaScript. Today's project was redeveloping a dysfunctional video media player. I think the file is a little old itself but I still
was able to practice declaring different variables using const, the .this method to direct where the video was being played directly & using fat arrow
functions inside of .addEventListener. You can find the last commit I made for that project above.

Documentating everything I'm learning like this helping me a lot, I'm really happy I finally started this. After a few more additons I'll make a basic web
application for this whole project. Working again with the JavaScript30 Challenge, always to find that there really is something new to learn everyday.
I began making a function called handleCheck which finds if a user has clicked on a checkbox or not. I'm also installing GitHub Co-Pilot today since
I am learning all of these commands on my own for the first time, I need some assistance & there's a 30 day free trial. After installing it, I thought it was more geared towards making commands in the terminal instead of vscode but It's working I suppose. I'm also starting to fully realize the depth of GitHub as I
start to work in other branches now. The handleCheck function works now, when you select a checkbox on the form & then click shift, after if you click
on another item in the form, you will have selected every option in between. That's why I declared variable named inBetween to clarify which items
must be selected from the if statement in the handleCheck function. You can find the last commit I made for that project here below

Today I picked up where I left off & started working on this 30 day JavaScript challenge I was told to practice with again & it's made a big difference so far.
I familiarized myself with methods like .strokeStyle & .moveTo, grew accustom to using tools like console.table & console.group instead of just console.log
while also getting to know how to use GitHub better. I'm more familiar with GitLab, so I know a lot of Git commands already but it's still new terrain.
After many attempts of failing to push to the proper branch, I stepped back to think & realized that I forgot to merge my old branch with the new before
inputting add ., commit -m "your-text-here" & git push origin main into my terminal. I also discovered a few other standard commands like git config
user.name & user.email. Now all my work is published.
