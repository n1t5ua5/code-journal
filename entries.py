# FALL / WINTER 2023

# 12/06/2023
# Today I picked up where I left off & started working on this 30 day JavaScript challenge I was told to practice with again & it's made a big difference so far.
# I familiarized myself with methods like .strokeStyle & .moveTo, grew accustom to using tools like console.table & console.group instead of just console.log
# while also getting to know how to use GitHub better. I'm more familiar with GitLab, so I know a lot of Git commands already but it's still new terrain.
# After many attempts of failing to push to the proper branch, I stepped back to think & realized that I forgot to merge my old branch with the new before
# inputting add ., commit -m "your-text-here" & git push origin main into my terminal. I also discovered a few other standard commands like git config
# user.name & user.email. Now all my work is published.

# Documentating everything I'm learning like this helping me a lot, I'm really happy I finally started this. After a few more additons I'll make a basic web
# application for this whole project. Working again with the JavaScript30 Challenge, always to find that there really is something new to learn everyday.
# I began making a function called handleCheck which finds if a user has clicked on a checkbox or not. I'm also installing GitHub Co-Pilot today since
# I am learning all of these commands on my own for the first time, I need some assistance. After installing it, I thought it was more geared towards
# making commands in the terminal instead of vscode but It's working I suppose. I'm also starting to fully realize the depth of GitHub as I
# start to work in other branches now. The handleCheck function works now, when you select a checkbox on the form & then click shift, after if you click
# on another item in the form, you will have selected every option in between. That's why I declared variable named inBetween to clarify which items
# must be selected from the if statement in the handleCheck function. You can find the last commit I made for that project here below

# I got a late start today but squeezed in some code nonetheless which made me happy because the momentum is definitely building & I'm feeling more comfortable
# writing my own functions & using different methods. As I continue along this JavaScript course, I'm noticing the continued important role that .addEventListener
# plays in using vanilla JavaScript. Today's project was redeveloping a dysfunctional video media player. I think the file is a little old itself but I still
# was able to practice declaring different variables using const, the .this method to direct where the video was being played directly & using fat arrow
# functions inside of .addEventListener. You can find the last commit I made for that project here: https://github.com/nitsua5/js30practice/commits/master

# Worked a tiny little project that detects which keys have pressed on the keyboard or not. I wrote an if statement that checked if said event happened, which
# looked for a variable I declared named secretCode. If the secretCode value appeared in the console after being written in the browser then a built in
# JavaScript function named cornify_add() was called. This built in function is a random thing built by developers that makes raindows & unicorns
# stuff like that appear in the browser when it it's called, lol. In my spare time I used a CMS program called Square to develop a demo site
# for a project I'm working. The domain was purchased, it's now hosted by Square & it's live. It needs more content though so I will
# work on that starting tomorrow while I continue to push through this 30 day coding challenge. Find my most recent commit below
