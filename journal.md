It's always rough starting a new semester but I feel more prepared than usual this time. The most helpful thing is having access to a tutor that can guide me in the right direction when I'm going off-path. The most difficult class so far is my math class & I probably won't do too much journaling about that one. However, the other two I'll have enough to write about even though neither course is based on coding. I know a little from my own research regarding Network Technologies but there's a lot to digest about Security Essentials. So far I've conducted some written research regarding network topologies for the first & threat actors for the second. Hacktivisits usually work independently of government organizations while state-sponsored attackers explicitly work on their behalf. That's all for now, folks!
